This is what I use before my travels:
Travel Documents Check all your travel documentations carefully and contact your travel agencies immediately if you have any queries or problems, It’s a good idea to have separate copies of all your documents (including passports) to carry and leave a copy of your itinerary with a relative or friend at home, All names on the booking match passport names of all travellers, Frequent flyer number has been advised and used in all bookings.</description></item><item><title>Travel Bucket List</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20180629travelbucketlist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20180629travelbucketlist/</guid><description>Soak in the Pamukkale thermal pools, Turkey

Another year and another Easter, time goes so fast. Three of us has decided to take a road trip to the Western Australia&amp;rsquo;s Southern Forest Region. We all knew the region pretty well so the trip was roughly planned and the accommodation was booked a few days before the trip.

I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb.</description></item></channel></rss>
