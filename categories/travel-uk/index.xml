It was cold comparing with the barmy 22 degrees in Edinburgh a few hours ago. Nevertheless, I was so excited. Here I come, road trip to south England!
Love The Car my rental car is a BMW-M135i First thing first, I needed a car! It was booked a month ago with Avis. The Avis branch can be found inside the St Pancras Station car park.</description></item><item><title>Scotland!</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140612scotland/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140612scotland/</guid><description>Edinburgh I love Edinburgh!
Edinburgh The receptionist at the hotel told me that it would be quicker to go to the King&amp;rsquo;s Cross train station by the Tube than taxi. It took me 30min on the Tube from Gloucester Road to the King&amp;rsquo;s Cross train station, not difficult at all.
Not many people were at the Platform 9 3/4 so I had a photo taken in front of it. :) By 9am, there was a long queue of people waiting to take photo there and the station staff had to put signs around to keep things in order.</description></item><item><title>Wondering around London</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</guid><description>The flight was so long. I kept walking around, eat (funny that I still felt hungry even though I did nothing but sitting there), nap and watch movies:
Bones season 8 - seem them all before, just killing time
Gravity - meh, its okay
The Grand Budapest Hotel - I loved it! It&amp;rsquo;s witty, smart, touching and shows the 1930s Europe
3 days to kill - Kevin Costner looked really old</description></item><item><title>Going to UK</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140605uk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140605uk/</guid><description>Overnight in Sydney Cubee Monkey I was still packing when Chris came to pick me up for the airport. :) I definitely started packing early this time but still, it became a last minute thing again. My Qantas flight was late as usual (One day, they will surprise me by being on time). The airport hotel Sydney for a night of transit is as boring as it can be. I don&amp;rsquo;t even get a phone in the room!</description></item><item><title>UK Trip Planning</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140522uk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140522uk/</guid><description>Oyster Card My visitor's Oyster Card My visitor&amp;rsquo;s Oyster Card has arrived today!
