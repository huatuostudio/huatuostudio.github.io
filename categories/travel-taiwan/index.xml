&lt;p>Chinese say that 4 is not a lucky number, clearly 04/04 is worse and it was totally true - I&amp;rsquo;ve had a terrible run today! ðŸ˜¢&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flight from Sydney to Hong Kong was delayed and the connecting flight from Hong Kong to Taipei left without me. :( Apparently, it was also the last flight for the day to fly over the channel. I was stranded in Hong Kong for the night with just my passport and a wallet in my bag. Note to self, I should always put an extra pair of undies in my carry on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is part of the fun of traveling - dealing with problems on the go, regardless how well I planned for weeks before the trip. :) I actually have never been left stranded with no luggage before. Sigh, there is always a first hey. I started to wonder what else could go wrong now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After some negotiation, the airline put me in the &lt;a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hkgap-hong-kong-skycity-marriott-hotel/">Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;d gave it 5 stars for the facility and the service! It was 12am when I checked in and I have to get up in 5 hours. I planned to watch some movies but after a hot shower, I pretty much passed out. ðŸ˜ƒ&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
