Ever since my mother moved to Canberra in March this year, I have been wanting to take her here for a meal. It has been raining for the past few weeks, and today it finally cleared up.

<p>John has bought me a ticket for a full 3 hours of <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb</a> for my birthday this year (thank you John!! 💕 ). I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">bridge climb</a>.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
