Edinburgh The receptionist at the hotel told me that it would be quicker to go to the King&amp;rsquo;s Cross train station by the Tube than taxi. It took me 30min on the Tube from Gloucester Road to the King&amp;rsquo;s Cross train station, not difficult at all.
Not many people were at the Platform 9 3/4 so I had a photo taken in front of it. :) By 9am, there was a long queue of people waiting to take photo there and the station staff had to put signs around to keep things in order.</description></item></channel></rss>
