It was cold comparing with the barmy 22 degrees in Edinburgh a few hours ago. Nevertheless, I was so excited. Here I come, road trip to south England!
Love The Car my rental car is a BMW-M135i First thing first, I needed a car! It was booked a month ago with Avis. The Avis branch can be found inside the St Pancras Station car park.</description></item><item><title>Wondering around London</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</guid><description>The flight was so long. I kept walking around, eat (funny that I still felt hungry even though I did nothing but sitting there), nap and watch movies:
Bones season 8 - seem them all before, just killing time
Gravity - meh, its okay
The Grand Budapest Hotel - I loved it! It&amp;rsquo;s witty, smart, touching and shows the 1930s Europe
3 days to kill - Kevin Costner looked really old</description></item></channel></rss>
