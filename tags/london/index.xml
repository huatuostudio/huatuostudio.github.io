It was cold comparing with the barmy 22 degrees in Edinburgh a few hours ago. Nevertheless, I was so excited. Here I come, road trip to south England!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First thing first, I needed a car! It was booked a month ago with Avis. The Avis branch can be found inside the &lt;a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/st-pancras-international-station/">St Pancras Station&lt;/a> car park. &lt;a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/st-pancras-international-station/">St Pancras Station&lt;/a> is cross the road from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station">King&amp;rsquo;s Cross Station&lt;/a>; one is international and the other is domestic. From the main departure information hall, follow the signals to the Car Park passing Boots, Patisserie Valerie and Pret A Manger. It took me a while to locate it because the office was small, shared with other rental companies (so do not just look for the Avis sign like I did) and it was at the entrance/exit of the car park.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wondering around London</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140609uk/</guid><description>&lt;p>The flight was so long. I kept walking around, eat (funny that I still felt hungry even though I did nothing but sitting there), nap and watch movies:&lt;/p>
