I have to say that I always thought the climb was an overpriced tourist thing so I have never done it. Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am (I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly slept!) to get ready for the climb.
We were very lucky that we were in a 5 people only group, comparing with the usual 10-15 people groups.</description></item></channel></rss>
