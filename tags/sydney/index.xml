My Qantas flight was late as usual (One day, they will surprise me by being on time). The airport hotel Sydney for a night of transit is as boring as it can be. I don&amp;rsquo;t even get a phone in the room!</description></item><item><title>Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130406harbourbridge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130406harbourbridge/</guid><description>The Experience John has bought me a ticket for a full 3 hours of Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb for my birthday this year (thank you John!! 💕 ). I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb.</description></item></channel></rss>
