&lt;p>I was still packing when Chris came to pick me up for the airport. :) I definitely started packing early this time but still, it became a last minute thing again. My Qantas flight was late as usual (One day, they will surprise me by being on time). The airport hotel Sydney for a night of transit is as boring as it can be. I don&amp;rsquo;t even get a phone in the room! Oh well, I really just need a place to sleep for a few hours.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
