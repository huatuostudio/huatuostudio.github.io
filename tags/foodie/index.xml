Ever since my mother moved to Canberra in March this year, I have been wanting to take her here for a meal. It has been raining for the past few weeks, and today it finally cleared up. The three of us wander here for lunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The garden cafÃ© was already quite busy at around 11:00 on a Sunday morning. Although it was a cold winter morning, the sun was out, and sitting by the outdoor electric heater, it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taiwan Impression</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20150405taiwan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20150405taiwan/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sleepless-in-hong-kong">Sleepless In Hong Kong&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Chinese say that 4 is not a lucky number, clearly 04/04 is worse and it was totally true - I&amp;rsquo;ve had a terrible run today! ðŸ˜¢&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flight from Sydney to Hong Kong was delayed and the connecting flight from Hong Kong to Taipei left without me. :( Apparently, it was also the last flight for the day to fly over the channel. I was stranded in Hong Kong for the night with just my passport and a wallet in my bag. Note to self, I should always put an extra pair of undies in my carry on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is part of the fun of traveling - dealing with problems on the go, regardless how well I planned for weeks before the trip. :) I actually have never been left stranded with no luggage before. Sigh, there is always a first hey. I started to wonder what else could go wrong now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After some negotiation, the airline put me in the &lt;a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hkgap-hong-kong-skycity-marriott-hotel/">Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;d gave it 5 stars for the facility and the service! It was 12am when I checked in and I have to get up in 5 hours. I planned to watch some movies but after a hot shower, I pretty much passed out. ðŸ˜ƒ&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To Make Japanese Pickled Ginger</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20130430japanesepickledginger/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20130430japanesepickledginger/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all over the net at the moment - ginger is the essential healthy power food! I don&amp;rsquo;t put a lot of ginger in my cooking but I love to eat Japanese pickled ginger from time to time. This is a recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve been using. The result was great, even mum gave it a thumbs up. Here is the VERY simple recipe on how to make Janpanese pickled ginger:&lt;/p>
