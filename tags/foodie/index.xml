Ever since my mother moved to Canberra in March this year, I have been wanting to take her here for a meal. It has been raining for the past few weeks, and today it finally cleared up. The three of us wander here for lunch.</p>
<p>The garden caf√© was already quite busy at around 11:00 on a Sunday morning. Although it was a cold winter morning, the sun was out, and sitting by the outdoor electric heater, it didn&rsquo;t feel cold at all.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Taiwan Impression</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20150405taiwan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20150405taiwan/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="sleepless-in-hong-kong">Sleepless In Hong Kong</h2>

<p>Chinese say that 4 is not a lucky number, clearly 04/04 is worse and it was totally true - I&rsquo;ve had a terrible run today! üò¢</p>
<p>The flight from Sydney to Hong Kong was delayed and the connecting flight from Hong Kong to Taipei left without me. :( Apparently, it was also the last flight for the day to fly over the channel. I was stranded in Hong Kong for the night with just my passport and a wallet in my bag. Note to self, I should always put an extra pair of undies in my carry on!</p>
<p>This is part of the fun of traveling - dealing with problems on the go, regardless how well I planned for weeks before the trip. :) I actually have never been left stranded with no luggage before. Sigh, there is always a first hey. I started to wonder what else could go wrong now.</p>

<p>After some negotiation, the airline put me in the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hkgap-hong-kong-skycity-marriott-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel</a>. I&rsquo;d gave it 5 stars for the facility and the service! It was 12am when I checked in and I have to get up in 5 hours. I planned to watch some movies but after a hot shower, I pretty much passed out. üòÉ</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How To Make Japanese Pickled Ginger</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130430japanesepickledginger/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130430japanesepickledginger/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s all over the net at the moment - ginger is the essential healthy power food! I don&rsquo;t put a lot of ginger in my cooking but I love to eat Japanese pickled ginger from time to time. This is a recipe I&rsquo;ve been using. The result was great, even mum gave it a thumbs up. Here is the VERY simple recipe on how to make Janpanese pickled ginger:</p>
