Today, they have celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary in the garden with their friends, including another couple who were celebrating their 64 years of marriage! The party started at lunch time and they were still there at 5pm ðŸ˜º&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such an amazing milestone! Long marriages - I wonder if itâ€™s going to be a thing belongs to the past generation only. Most of my friends got married later in life and many marriages did not last long. There seem to be a different kind of expiration date on marriages these days. Not sure if thatâ€™s sad or just the way things are now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Memory of Mr Cheng</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20160410teacher/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20160410teacher/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-1-">â€“ 1 â€“&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we were in the fifth and sixth grades, Mr Cheng&amp;rsquo;s geography classes were captivating and lively. He often veered off-topic, sharing interesting tidbits that kept us engaged. However, this meant the teaching plan frequently fell behind. The curriculum intended for the first semester of fifth grade had to be pushed to the second semester, continuing the cycle. By the second semester of sixth grade, there was no more room for postponements. What was the solution? Sunday make-up classes!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
