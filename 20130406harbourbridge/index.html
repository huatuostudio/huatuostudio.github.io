John has bought me a ticket for a full 3 hours of Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb for my birthday this year (thank you John!! 💕 ). I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing.

I guess that it might has something to do with the higher price for the morning climb - for the sunrise view. Everyone got to know each other pretty quickly and we were able to complete the pre-climb training ahead of schedule. The training was to give you an idea of what to or not to do on the bridge. We then had to change into the overall provided by the company. We were not allowed to take anything with us to the bridge.</p><p>A bigger group would waste a lot of time on waiting for slow walker etc., because everyone has to be chained to the side of the bridge and has to walk in a line the whole time. With only 5 people, we were able to chat with each other with or without of the headphones. We could yell at each other if anyone wanted to stop for a quick photo - yes, only the guide has a camera and the camera is chained to him as well. The guide was a cute young guy. 😂 He told us lots stories and history about the bridge. For example, did you know that a diamond ring was lost during a proposal on top of the bridge? Every since then, if one plan for a proposal on top of the bridge, one need to chain the ring on the wrist. If the girl says yes, then the ring will be transferred to her finger without leaving the chain. 😅 FYI, the lost diamond ring was not recovered so look carefully when you walk on the bridge. haha…</p><p>The view on top of the bridge was amazing! I was in love with it. We could see the rain on the left hand side of the sky yet on the other side, the sun rose behind the clouds. I was very impressed! It was so beautiful! It was so worth the money! I&rsquo;m going to tell everyone to do this! No wonder so many people have marriage proposals here! 😂</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXdeYT8m-b4xJ2gOlevXJb7sWnmLMIHkVICmW7MrYor6vjCU67TZcw-kjpAuZj3qLgvu-2QtFPb39qC591q_MfR8vXuRbLLXZlHHEFRJCka2s3JHKGn2JdawyV7UDf9vtVQ7Sdwjpmk2Fe7tdu9ELvj=w888-h666-no?authuser=0" alt="the view from the top!" title="the view from the top!"></p><p>It was very windy on the top of the bridge. I really understood why everything has to be chained to the hand rail. We were given “survival packs” to be chained on ourselves. I was so glad to find a jumper in it because it was freezing too.</p><p>There were plenty time on top of the bridge for photos, stories, history talk and time to just enjoying the view. The walk down the bridge is on the other side of the bridge. We enjoyed the different view and marveled the structure of the bridge. It was said that it takes 3 years to maintain the bridge and even more to repaint. It was said that when one round of work completes, its most likely time for the next round to start again! It makes you appreciate the design and the engineering of the bridge even more!</p><p>Three of us (Steve & Sam), we have had such a good time that I was totally shocked that the whole climb took more than 2 hours! It was time for pancakes and coffee!</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXvVZfJ52OgG5F-xswZ0YBfsrNRIGc1whtcwmKE7ghKjV3UEuQXbehrsv6m4CmWqyOlBPF57bNLnLLluxdCMOz8uMYYuwlRgkQifHEHjjG2Oph5MS-Ul6iC_RF-oRjHL9L4h2UKFerk2Vi9dbvR-oDg=w620-h658-no?authuser=0" alt=Breakfast title=Breakfast></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX-LNCfAJGpTaeDXC6zV8z_2cp2oRn_zD80y8F_RMdn3JThYyVFIhPV-hnCOqdWTjfbPDXRaICq3edNTNLJoXdy-eQfBoTZsURSwj8FawtfT35LWYOss3E6NEXTWeEoOX6V5DS0SXjII1CRh7vt6SZj=w620-h521-no?authuser=0" alt=Dinner title=Dinner></p><h2 id=the-verdict>The Verdict</h2><p>It&rsquo;s great, do it! If you plan to visit <a href=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge>Sydney</a>, book for a <a href=http://www.bridgeclimb.com/>Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb</a> and ask the guide to tell you the story about how they <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oprah-climbs-the-sydney-harbour-bridge-20101212-18tr9.html>made it happen for Oprah in 2010</a>.</p><h2 id=side-notes>Side Notes</h2><ul><li>I stayed in the city because I wanted a short walk to the bridge in the early morning. I&rsquo;ve not walked around the city of Sydney at 3am before. Relatively safe, interesting people hanging around the streets at this hour, very different from the day!</li><li>This 3.5 star hotel needs thicker walls and windows! I&rsquo;ve asked for a higher level and a quiet floor as usual. I kept waken up by the noise from the street - they do travel up. The room next door kept you know what going for the whole night and from the noise, you could tell that there were a few people there! LOL I&rsquo;ve hardly slept at all between downstairs and the next door. This is why after the climb and breakfast, even with all the sugar from the pancakes, I wanted a nap! I won&rsquo;t stay in this hotel again!</li></ul><h2 id=food-highlights>Food Highlights</h2><p>All pretty good, enjoyed them all!
