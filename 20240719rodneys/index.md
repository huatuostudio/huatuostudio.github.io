# Rodney's Nursery & Garden Center


If you are a Canberran and you enjoy gardening and growing vegetables, you should know about Rodney's nursery and his café. Ever since my mother moved to Canberra in March this year, I have been wanting to take her here for a meal. It has been raining for the past few weeks, and today it finally cleared up. The three of us wander here for lunch.

The garden café was already quite busy at around 11:00 on a Sunday morning. Although it was a cold winter morning, the sun was out, and sitting by the outdoor electric heater, it didn't feel cold at all.

Rodney's nursery café is dog-friendly, and we even saw a guest bring in a little pig, which was so cute!

We had a sumptuous meal, chatted, read the newspaper, and enjoyed the joyful atmosphere around us. We happily took a stroll around the nursery. Although we didn't buy any plants, we thoroughly enjoyed the various blooming camellias, which were beautiful and vibrant! It was truly a lovely morning!
