This is what I use before my travels:
Travel Documents Check all your travel documentations carefully and contact your travel agencies immediately if you have any queries or problems, It’s a good idea to have separate copies of all your documents (including passports) to carry and leave a copy of your itinerary with a relative or friend at home, All names on the booking match passport names of all travellers, Frequent flyer number has been advised and used in all bookings.</description></item><item><title>Road Trip WA</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20160322roadtripwa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20160322roadtripwa/</guid><description></description></item><item><title>Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130406harbourbridge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130406harbourbridge/</guid><description>John has bought me a ticket for a full 3 hours of Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb for my birthday this year (thank you John!! 💕 ). I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb.</description></item></channel></rss>
