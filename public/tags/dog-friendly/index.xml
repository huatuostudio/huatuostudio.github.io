      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a Canberran and you enjoy gardening and growing vegetables, you should know about Rodney&amp;rsquo;s nursery and his café. Ever since my mother moved to Canberra in March this year, I have been wanting to take her here for a meal. It has been raining for the past few weeks, and today it finally cleared up. The three of us wander here for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden café was already quite busy at around 11:00 on a Sunday morning. Although it was a cold winter morning, the sun was out, and sitting by the outdoor electric heater, it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel cold at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
