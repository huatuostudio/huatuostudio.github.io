&lt;p&gt;When we were in the fifth and sixth grades, Mr Cheng&amp;rsquo;s geography classes were captivating and lively. He often veered off-topic, sharing interesting tidbits that kept us engaged. However, this meant the teaching plan frequently fell behind. The curriculum intended for the first semester of fifth grade had to be pushed to the second semester, continuing the cycle. By the second semester of sixth grade, there was no more room for postponements. What was the solution? Sunday make-up classes!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
