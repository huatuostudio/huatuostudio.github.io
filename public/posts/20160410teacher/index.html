<p>When we were in the fifth and sixth grades, Mr Cheng&rsquo;s geography classes were captivating and lively. He often veered off-topic, sharing interesting tidbits that kept us engaged. However, this meant the teaching plan frequently fell behind. The curriculum intended for the first semester of fifth grade had to be pushed to the second semester, continuing the cycle. By the second semester of sixth grade, there was no more room for postponements. What was the solution? Sunday make-up classes!</p>
<p>I often struggled to wake up early in the morning, and Sunday make-up classes made it even harder, leading to frequent tardiness. Fortunately, Mr Cheng was lenient about it. However, several times, just as I reached the classroom door, he would call my name, &ldquo;What is the main product of the Liaodong Peninsula?&rdquo; I was still at the door, stammering out &ldquo;Peanuts!&rdquo; after a long pause, which always brought a wave of laughter from the class. &ldquo;Good, sit down, one point.&rdquo; Back then, we used a five-point grading system, and that’s how I ended up with three &ldquo;one points&rdquo; in a row.
As the final exam approached, I realized these three &ldquo;one points&rdquo; were serious. I focused diligently on reviewing geography and managed to score &ldquo;five points&rdquo; on the exam. However, because of those three &ldquo;one points,&rdquo; Mr Cheng gave me a &ldquo;three points&rdquo; on the report card, not quite in line with the five-point system. But I didn&rsquo;t mind. Once, in the library corridor, I overheard Mr Cheng telling another teacher, &ldquo;Cao Zhong is a really smart kid.&rdquo; That meant the world to me.</p>
<p>Mr Cheng frequently assigned extracurricular tasks like drawing maps. We drew maps of each province using the grid method by hand on blank paper. He also introduced us to a fun game, &ldquo;taking the train,&rdquo; where we&rsquo;d plan routes from Nanjing to Beijing, identifying major cities and even making mid-journey transfers. These exercises ingrained the maps of China and the world in my mind. I became very familiar with China&rsquo;s transportation lines.</p>
<p>Decades later, when a neighbor was planning a business trip, I advised her on the best route: take the train from Nanjing to a specific location, switch to a boat, and then transfer to a long-distance bus. She asked curiously, &ldquo;Have you traveled this route?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I learned about it in elementary school from my geography teacher.&rdquo; Mr Cheng&rsquo;s influence instilled in me a habit of looking at maps. I consult maps when needed and enjoy looking at them in my free time. Studying maps feels like a mental journey to me. Mr Cheng brought geography to life, and I am forever grateful to him and remember him always.</p>
<h2 id="-2">– 2 –<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-2">#</a></h2>
<p>Before the summer vacation of the fifth grade, a few boys in our class secretly went to bathe by Xuanwu Lake at Taiping Gate. The first time, Mr Cheng didn&rsquo;t find out. The second time, a few classmates went again (I didn&rsquo;t go that time), and somehow, Mr Cheng found out. Despite his age, Mr Cheng ran all the way to Taiping Gate to bring them back. After explaining the reasons, he didn&rsquo;t criticize them in front of the class. It was his sincerity that deeply moved the students. At that time, there were no bicycles, and TeacMrher Cheng was quite old, yet he made the effort. From that point until graduation, no student ever bathed at Xuanwu Lake at Taiping Gate again. This is why I previously mentioned Mr Cheng as a kind teacher.</p>
<p>On a side note, several years later, a boy in our class, mistreated by his parents, committed suicide by ingesting potassium cyanide at the same spot by Xuanwu Lake at Taiping Gate.</p>
<p>The days in primary school were the happiest times of my life. Consequently, I often reminisce about my life in primary school. Mr Cheng, our homeroom teacher for fifth and sixth grades, is someone I frequently remember. He was a kind teacher and a compassionate elder. During my time in Siyang, we often met since I was a teacher there. After Mr Cheng returned to Nanjing, we lost contact. In the blink of an eye, several decades have passed.</p>

<p>Today, I received an article from Cao Zhong, one of Grandpa’s students. It filled with fond memories (see above 1) about Grandpa. Along with recollections of Grandpa from Liu Hong, a classmate from Nanshi Affiliated Primary School (see above 2). Grandpa never taught me at school; naturally, the Grandpa I knew at home was a completely different person. Reading these little stories brought a smile to my face. Being a teacher is truly wonderful; they remain forever in their students&rsquo; memories. 👏</p>
