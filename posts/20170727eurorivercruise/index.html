Enjoy dinner on board tonight, as your journey continues late into the evening.\nDay 13: Disembark your ship in Cologne and drive to the town of Bruhl. Return to Cologne and enjoy some time at leisure. Pay a visit to Augustusburg Castle and Falkenlust hunting lodge, the lavish residences of archbishop-elector Clemens August.
