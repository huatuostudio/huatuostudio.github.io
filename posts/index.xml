This is what I use before my travels:
Travel Documents Check all your travel documentations carefully and contact your travel agencies immediately if you have any queries or problems, It‚Äôs a good idea to have separate copies of all your documents (including passports) to carry and leave a copy of your itinerary with a relative or friend at home, All names on the booking match passport names of all travellers, Frequent flyer number has been advised and used in all bookings.</description></item><item><title>Travel Bucket List</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20180629travelbucketlist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20180629travelbucketlist/</guid><description>Soak in the Pamukkale thermal pools, Turkey

Another year and another Easter, time goes so fast. Three of us has decided to take a road trip to the Western Australia&amp;rsquo;s Southern Forest Region. We all knew the region pretty well so the trip was roughly planned and the accommodation was booked a few days before the trip.

<p>Chinese say that 4 is not a lucky number, clearly 04/04 is worse and it was totally true - I&rsquo;ve had a terrible run today! üò¢</p>
<p>The flight from Sydney to Hong Kong was delayed and the connecting flight from Hong Kong to Taipei left without me. :( Apparently, it was also the last flight for the day to fly over the channel. I was stranded in Hong Kong for the night with just my passport and a wallet in my bag. Note to self, I should always put an extra pair of undies in my carry on!</p>
<p>This is part of the fun of traveling - dealing with problems on the go, regardless how well I planned for weeks before the trip. :) I actually have never been left stranded with no luggage before. Sigh, there is always a first hey. I started to wonder what else could go wrong now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After some negotiation, the airline put me in the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hkgap-hong-kong-skycity-marriott-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel</a>. I&rsquo;d gave it 5 stars for the facility and the service! It was 12am when I checked in and I have to get up in 5 hours. I planned to watch some movies but after a hot shower, I pretty much passed out. üòÉ</p>]]></description></item><item><title>RSPCA Pet Quiz Website</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140905petquiz/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20140905petquiz/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m giving myself a üåü for finishing a little volunteer project for RSPCA (AU) ACT. :-)
The idea is to create a website that contains a Pet Quiz where people answer a few questions to find out what kind of pet is the best suitable for them. The logic for the website is pretty simple so I kept the design simple and clean too. The website is going to be used on iPads in RSPCA ACT&amp;rsquo;s booth at this year&amp;rsquo;s Florida (URL: http://rspcapetquiz.</description></item><item><title>How To Make Japanese Pickled Ginger</title><link>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130430japanesepickledginger/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><author>@huatuostudio</author><guid>https://huatuostudio.github.io/20130430japanesepickledginger/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s all over the net at the moment - ginger is the essential healthy power food! I don&amp;rsquo;t put a lot of ginger in my cooking but I love to eat Japanese pickled ginger from time to time. This is a recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve been using. The result was great, even mum gave it a thumbs up. Here is the VERY simple recipe on how to make Janpanese pickled ginger:

I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb.</description></item></channel></rss>
