This is what I use before my travels:
Travel Documents

Check all your travel documentations carefully and contact your travel agencies immediately if you have any queries or problems,
It’s a good idea to have separate copies of all your documents (including passports) to carry and leave a copy of your itinerary with a relative or friend at home,
All names on the booking match passport names of all travellers,
Frequent flyer number has been advised and used in all bookings.

Passports

Check that your passport and visas are in order. Most countries require a minimum of 6 months’ validity on your passport (from your return date). If you are travelling on a non-Australian passport then you must carry correct re-entry documentation.
Check that you have the correct visa and passport type for your destination

Flight confirmation
Although most airlines do not require you to reconfirm, still, check your flight schedule at least 24 hours prior to departure. Airlines have the right to change flight times and dates without notice. Download the airline&rsquo;s app and turn on notification."><meta name=author content="@huatuostudio"><link rel=canonical href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20181224travelchecklist/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20181224travelchecklist/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://huatuostudio.github.io/posts/20181224travelchecklist/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Hua Tuo Studio"><meta property="og:title" content="Travel Checklist"><meta property="og:description" content="Life is simpler with a checklist.
