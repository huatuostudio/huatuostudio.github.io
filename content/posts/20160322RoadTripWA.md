2016 Easter. Another year and another Easter, time goes so fast. Three of us has decided to take a road trip to the Western Australia's [Southern Forest Region](http://www.southernforests.com.au). We all knew the region pretty well so the trip was roughly planned and the accommodation was booked a few days before the trip.
## The Itinerary

### Day 1

- Leave [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth)

- Rest at [Bunbury](http://www.bunbury.wa.gov.au/) (1.5hrs), change driver

- Take the National Route 1 from [Bunbury](http://www.bunbury.wa.gov.au/) to [Walpole](http://www.walpole.com.au/), rest at [Bridgetown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown,_Western_Australia) and [Manjimup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjimup,_Western_Australia)

- Arrive at [Nornalop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornalup,_Western_Australia) accommodation (3+hrs), rest

- Arrive at [Valley of the Giants](http://www.valleyofthegiants.com.au/)

- Visit the [Tree Top Walk](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php)

- Dinner at [Walpole](http://www.walpole.com.au/) (10min drive from [Nornalop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornalup,_Western_Australia))

### Day 2

- Leave [Nornalop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornalup,_Western_Australia)

- Visit [Elephant Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Rocks_(Western_Australia)) and [Greens Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greens_Pool) ([William Bay National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bay_National_Park))

- Lunch at [Denmark](http://www.denmark.com.au/)

- Drive back to [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) (Albany Highway is the closest and simplest way to get back to [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) - just keep driving for 3-4 hours and you are there. Take the left turn to Mt. Barker Road outside of [Denmark](http://www.denmark.com.au/), to cut through to Albany Highway, instead of driving from [Denmark](http://www.denmark.com.au/) to Albany. It's a nice drive through the State Forest too.)

Random, ðŸ˜‚ I was in Perth City when I found this:

I thought that it was a fantastic discovery before starting a road trip! ðŸ˜ƒ In case that you want to find it yourself, it's near the corner of the St. Georges Terrace and Barrack Street in Perth City, opposite of the Stirling Gardens.

## Day 1
### Walpole & Nornalop

We planned to leave [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) at 8am. We actually left [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth)Â around 9.30am due to the last minute search of a GPS. I decided not to get upset about it. ðŸ˜ƒ

Our first resting stop: [Bunbury](http://www.bunbury.wa.gov.au/).Â It's been years since I last visited [Bunbury](http://www.bunbury.wa.gov.au/). We drove straight to the [Marlston Hill Lookout Tower](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g255364-d6366462-Reviews-Marlston_Hill_Lookout_Tower-Bunbury_Western_Australia.html). It was a bit windy at the top of the tower but the view was stunning. It's a great resting point.

The sandy beach ofÂ [Bunbury](http://www.bunbury.wa.gov.au/). I took this photo while dad ran onto the beach to chase his hat. :) I caught a photo of him with his arms in the air (trying to hold onto his hat) and his hat floating in the air too (flying away). I laughed every time when I saw that photo.

The second part of the drive was not boring. There were plenty stopping/resting points at one of the little towns along the route. We kept eating and chatting. The view was gorgeous whence we entered theÂ [Southern Forest](http://www.southernforests.com.au) Region of WA. Giant tress covers both side of the road. It was a fantastic drive. I was also pulled over 3 times by the cops checking for alcohol, 3 times!

We stayed at [Nornalup Riverside Chalets](http://www.nornalupriversidechalets.com.au). It was difficult to book for an overnight accommodation during Easter. Marge was nice enough to take us in. The Chalets are located on the Â Riverside Drive by the side of the [Frankland River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankland_River). The Chalets were reasonably priced and they have everything you need for a night's stay. You can cook your own dinner or drive to Walpole for a meal. We went to the [Top Deck Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g488368-d2627089-Reviews-Top_Deck_Cafe-Walpole_Western_Australia.html) in Walpole. We were happy with the food, the service was good too.

I discovered some mushroom on the road side. They pushed through tar and gravel road surface and stood like little soldiers. I was so proud of them. Isn't life amazing?

>The [Tree Top Walk](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php) 600-metre walk has a gentle gradient, suitable for children and all ages, including wheelchairs and strollers.
A walk trail links the [Tree Top Walk](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php) to the Ancient Empire boardwalk where you can get up close and personal to the 400-year-old giants of the forest.

This is the first time I come to the [Tree Top Walk](ttp://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php) in Western Australia.

The [Tree Top Walk](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php) is located at the [Valley of the Giants](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/). Don't you just love the name! Whenever I saw the name, I always had the image of the [Ent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent) from the [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) in my mind.

The [Valley of the Giants' website](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/) contain good information about the place and everything else related to it. Head over [there](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/) if you would like to plan for a trip too.

I enjoyed my walk at the top. Although, I don't think one should be on this walk if one is not comfortable with heights. The walking path wave slightly when a few people walk on it with unsynchronised steps. It was pretty fun for me! It sounded like the waves in the ocean when the wind blew pass - the trees started dancing and I could hear them whispering in our ears! I wonder what stories they would tell after standing there for 100s of years.

The Ancient Empire boardwalk is a 20 minute walk under the [Tree Top Walk](http://valleyofthegiants.com.au/_menus/Attraction/Tree_Top_Walk.php). It was certainly a different view from the bottom up! I could really appreciated the height of the [Giant Tingle Trees (Eucalypts)](https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/site/giant-tingle-tree) from the ground - like the giant protectors of the forest. The air was crisp and sun shone through the branches. I've read that it's a quite busy touristy attraction but we must have missed ALL the tourist groups! We gladly enjoyed the quietness and serenity of being one with the forest - it was such a magical feeling! I've learned so much from the stories left along the walkways describing the trees, the eco-system and the surrounding area. I was sure that I could easily spent an hour there, wandering around and marvel the lives in the forest. I strongly suggest everyone to take a trip there when in the area!

After a good night sleep, I woke up to cool crisp air. I put on a jacket, picked up a cup of coffee and walked out of our chalet. It was a bit cloudy and the air was the mix of the tree, the flowers and the grass. I wished that I could put them into jars for late (or sell them to China and make millions! ðŸ˜ƒ ). The front lawn felt like a green carpet, slightly wet. The kookaburras and some other birds were already singing and playing amongst the trees. I walked straight down to the river side. The water flows south in a steady pace and on the other side, it was a national park. Giant trees stood there along the banks. The more I looked at them, the more mysterious they seemed. I was fully expecting some kind of monster jumping out of the woods - thank goodness that there was a river protecting me. LOL! What would the monster look like? I hoped that it could not fly! ðŸ˜ƒ I dragged my rampaging imagination back and sat down on a small jetty, sipping hot coffee, relaxing and just enjoying this peaceful morning all by myself... until the others got up. They joined me for a walk into the woods. The topic for discussion was how long would each of us live in the woods like this. I was pretty sure that I could easily stay there for a month. ðŸ˜ƒ

After breakfast, we took off to Denmark and saw the Elephant Rock with the Green Pool. I have been there before and Denmark is truly a beautiful spot in south WA.

We started a long drive (&gt;4hrs) back to Perth after a lovely lunch in Denmark. There is a shortcut to Albany Highway from Denmark: drive out of Denmark and take a left onto Mt. Barker Road.

We had a great time on this road trip. We are truly blessed to be able to call this beautiful land home.
