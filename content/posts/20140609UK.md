The flight was so long. I kept walking around, eat (funny that I still felt hungry even though I did nothing but sitting there), nap and watch movies:

- [Bones](http://www.fox.com/bones/) season 8 - seem them all before, just killing time

- [Gravity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/) - meh, its okay

- [The Grand Budapest Hotel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/) - I loved it! It's witty, smart, touching and shows the 1930s Europe

- [3 days to kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2172934/) - Kevin Costner looked really old

I took Ben's advise and booked a car with [Swift](http://www.swiftcars.co.uk/). The driver held a name card at the arrival and we were at the hotel within 30min.

## Hello London!

OMG, after what seemed like a life time of flying, finally, I've arrived in London! 

I'm staying at the [Millennium Bailey's Hotel Kensington](http://www.millenniumhotels.co.uk/millenniumbaileys/). This is a nice hotel at a great location. The local bus, hop on and hop off bus  and the [Tube](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/) station are all across road. There are plenty shops ([Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/) and [Waitrose](http://www.waitrose.com/)), hotels, restaurants, bars and pubs around. I love the gardens and parks here too. It's in walking distance to [Knightsbridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightsbridge), [Hyde Park](http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park), [Kensington Palace](http://www.hrp.org.uk/KensingtonPalace/), [VandA Museum](http://www.vam.ac.uk/) etc.

It rained only one morning since I've arrived in UK. The sun is hot during the day and the air is crisp clear at night - perfect! The day light lasts from 5am to 9pm - just right for get out and about.

I discovered [Ricola](http://www.ricola.com/en-ch) drops in London and I had it with me during the whole trip, very addictive.

Five days in London was great and I really enjoyed it. However, it felt like that I was just ticking off places on a to-go list. I have seen all those places on TV etc and now I have seen them in person. Nothing had shocked me yet, the TV shows were telling the truth! :) It was getting a bit boring and I was looking forward to leave for Scotland.
