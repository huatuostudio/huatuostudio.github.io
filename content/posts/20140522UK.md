My visitor's [Oyster Card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do) has arrived today! If you want to get an [Oyster Card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do) before travelling to London, do a [Google](http://www.google.com) search to find an agent in your own country so you can purchase the card in your local currency. [Transport for London](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster) has more information on the [Oyster Card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do) and a list of agents around the world.

London, I will see you soon! **I'm so excited!!** üòÇ üêæ üíã üíì

I'm so excited that I am planning my trip to UK! I've always wanted to visit UK, it feels like a dream becoming true!

First thing first, Matt "educated" me with the [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10) below on the differences between UK, England and the Great Britain. It turned out that UK = [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . The fact that I'm only going to Britain + Scotland + Wales (if I have time), not Ireland, I should really tell people that I'm going to England, not UK. Watch the [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10), it's pretty fun!

{{< youtube rNu8XDBSn10 >}}

### 1. Hotels

I find [booking.com](http://www.booking.com) a good source to start with and I booked most of my stays for this trip using this site. I like the fact that [booking.com](http://www.booking.com) allows me to:

- add bookings to my ical
- add bookings to passbook
- give me directions to the booked locations

[booking.com](http://www.booking.com) also had a few more choices than [expedia.com](http://www.expedia.com).

Always check with [tripadvisor.com](http://www.tripadvisor.com) for reviews and "real" photos before make the booking!

To read up on the local area where you are staying, I use [Street Check UK](http://www.streetcheck.co.uk) (a very useful site).

### 2. Transport

A few people told me that for long train trips, one must book as early as one can. I booked return train ticket from London to Edinburgh a few weeks before travel date for 80¬£* - I've been told that price was very cheap!

I recommend walking when traveling in London. If needs to, take the iconic [double decker bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-decker_bus) or get on the [Tube](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/). Here is a [map](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube) for the [Tube](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/), it's easy to use and worry free. Pre-order an [Oyster Card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do) can save you time and money when using the [Tube](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/).

### 3. Wifi

I only purchase data packs when I'm overseas and if I need to make phone calls, I would use [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) credits. It's cheaper too. Most decent accommodations will offer free wifi these days so I can check email, backup photos, make FaceTime or Skype to Skype calls.

I carry a wifi device that connects 5 devices. My wifi device is not locked down to any telecommunication company so any SIM card would work with it, but it also means that I need to update its APN settings when I'm in a different country before I can use it. APN settings for [vodafone.co.uk](http://vodafone.co.uk) is:
<em><span style="color:#0000ff;">APN : wap.vodafone.co.uk</span></em>
<em><span style="color:#0000ff;"> Username: wap</span></em>
<em><span style="color:#0000ff;"> Password: wap</span></em>

### 4.Roaming
I do not use international mobile roaming services but for your information, here are [Optus](http://www.Optus.com.au)'s rates for United Arab Emirates (collected at June 2014):

- calls to Aus = $2.00/min to make and receive, 
- calls within United Arab Emirates = $2.00/min to make and receive, 
- SMS = $1.00 per SMS to send and  free to receive, data = $1.00/MB. 
- Check your balance for free: call 555 or SMS 'Bal' to 9999. 
- To recharge: call 555. More info at optus.com.au/travel. 
- To stop roaming while overseas free call +61280825678 from an Optus mobile. 

Finally, if this is your first time in UK, even though you speak English well, the following might still be helpful:
