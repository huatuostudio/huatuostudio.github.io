My neighbours are in their 90s. Today, they have celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary in the garden with their friends, including another couple who were celebrating their 64 years of marriage! The party started at lunch time and they were still there at 5pm ðŸ˜º 

Such an amazing milestone! Long marriages - I wonder if itâ€™s going to be a thing belongs to the past generation only. Most of my friends got married later in life and many marriages did not last long. There seem to be a different kind of expiration date on marriages these days. Not sure if thatâ€™s sad or just the way things are now.

Imagine spending every day with someone for 69 years! My neighbours are happy. They support each other in their fragile old age. They have great grandchildren now. Their sons and daughters take turns to visit with their grandchildren. The husband still cracks jokes in his 90s. Just today, he has said that his wife was changing to go out to night clubs when I asked why she has left the party early. I went inside of the house to talk to her. She laughed and said that she was tired and her hearing aid was failing so she couldn't hear all the conversations. 

They live independently. I offered to do grocery for them or to drive them to the shops sometimes. They always said that if they could, they would manage themselves. Luckily we live within walking distance to the shops. Keep moving and be happy must be the key to longevity.

I hear more and more on AI and robots used to assist older people. It's not just a trend; it's inevitable. But would that really able to replace human interactions?
