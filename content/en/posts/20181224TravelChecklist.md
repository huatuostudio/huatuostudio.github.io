Life is simpler with a checklist. This is what I use before my travels:

# Travel Documents

- Check all your travel documentations carefully and contact your travel agencies immediately if you have any queries or problems,
- It’s a good idea to have separate copies of all your documents (including passports) to carry and leave a copy of your itinerary with a relative or friend at home,
- All names on the booking match passport names of all travellers,
- Frequent flyer number has been advised and used in all bookings.

# Passports

- Check that your passport and visas are in order. Most countries require a minimum of 6 months’ validity on your passport (from your return date). If you are travelling on a non-Australian passport then you must carry correct re-entry documentation.
- Check that you have the correct visa and passport type for your destination

# Flight confirmation

Although most airlines do not require you to reconfirm, still, check your flight schedule at least 24 hours prior to departure. Airlines have the right to change flight times and dates without notice. Download the airline's app and turn on notification.

Make sure that seating and meal requests for flights are confirmed.

# Baggage Allowances and Regulations

- Check your baggage allowance carefully as you may incur an additional charge for excess baggage.
- Check your airline baggage safety notices that detail items that cannont be carrid or only carried in checked baggage. Strict regulations are in place regarding the carrying of liquids, aerosols and gels in hand luggage on all international flights into and out of Australia. 
- Check with your travel agent or airline for further information or refer to the [Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development (Australia)](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au) and local government websites on what can or cannot be brought into Australia.

# Duty-Free goods

These vary depending on your country of destination. Visit [Australian Customs website](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au) for the latest allowance information.
