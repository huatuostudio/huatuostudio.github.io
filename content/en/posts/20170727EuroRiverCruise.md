**Day 7**: Continue along the Danube River to the enchanting town of Regensburg, located in the southern region of the Bavarian Forest. Here, a guided tour along its cobblestone lanes tells of the medieval town’s journey through the ages. Afterwards, wander the historic streets at your own pace.

**Day 8**: Arrive in Nuremberg, the site of Hitler’s now infamous rallies, which played a pivotal role for the Nazis during World War II. Take a city tour this afternoon, which includes sights such as the Zeppelin Field and Palace of Justice.

**Day 9**: One of the few German cities that wasn’t destroyed during World War II, World Heritage-listed Bamberg beckons your attention this morning. You’ll gain great insight during a locally guided tour of the historic city centre.

**Day 10**: Verdant hills and rich vineyards sit on the edge of Würzburg, while the Main River is a prominent feature of this stunning city. The architectural beauty that further defines Würzburg is on show today as you admire its magnificent baroque palace, the Würzburg Residence. Here, a walk through Würzburg Court Garden is a delight, with its terraced gardens and serene water basin.

**Day 11**: Arrive at the beautifully evocative town of Miltenberg. After morning tea return to your ship and enjoy time at leisure.

**Day 13**: Disembark your ship in Cologne and drive to the town of Bruhl. Return to Cologne and enjoy some time at leisure. Pay a visit to Augustusburg Castle and Falkenlust hunting lodge, the lavish residences of archbishop-elector Clemens August. On a tour of the castle, learn stories of its infamous former resident and enjoy a walk through its gardens between the lodge and the castle.

**Day 14**: Studded with low bridges and historic houses, Amsterdam’s network of canals lends the city its nickname, ‘Venice of the North’. Dock in the city’s heart and board a glass-top boat to discover the city’s waterside facades, watching the bicycle-loving locals ride along with carefree abandon as you drift by. Back on land, enjoy some free time to explore the city, before a Captain’s Farewell Dinner on board your river ship.
