This website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

I've been using the [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io) [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) for a long time and it just won't do anymore. I've found [Paper](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/) and liked it. So, I'm using [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) now for this webiste. ðŸ˜º 

I've been avoiding from spending time learning Hugo for so long. For this update, I'm going to learn while I build so I'm not hacking it blindly. I'm actually going to put some thoughts into designing and structuring the site. ðŸ˜º 

# Planning
What the website needs to have?
- Subscription - good to have
- Comments/discussion board - good to have
- Multilingual - must have
- Search - must have
- Archive and category - must have
- Image gallery - good to have
- Embed Instagram - maybe
- Payment - maybe

It's a sunny winter afternoon (-4 degrees in the morning), perfect, lets get on with this.

# Build the site
1. copy and backup the while website folder locally
1. check hugo version, run "hugo version" in terminal
1. I need to update hugo, run "brew upgrade hugo" in terminal
2. go to folder 1 level above - parent folder
3. run "hugo new site huatuostudio.github.io --force --format yaml" in terminal
1. download PaperMod theme and extract the folder from zip file
1. move the folder inside of the themems folder
1. run "git init" in terminal



# Configurations

## Display the full language name
One of the major decision point to use the theme is that it has multilingual support. [Look Scanned Blog](https://blog.lookscanned.io/posts/custom-language-select-in-hugo-papermod/) has a good post on how to modify the language selector.

I wanted to keep things simple but I want to have the language display fullname i.e. "English" istead of "en". To do that, just add the line below to the hugo.yaml file. 

```Hugo
params:
  displayFullLangName: true
```

## Add a CNAME

## Add a favicon

## Add Apple touch icon
