This website is powered by Hugo.

I've been using the Hugo template [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) for a long time and it just won't do anymore. I've found [Paper](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/) and liked it. So, I'm using [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) now for this webiste. ðŸ˜º 

I've been avoiding from spending time learning Hugo for so long. For this update, I'm going to learn while I build so I'm not hacking it blindly. I'm actually going to put some thoughts into designing and structuring the site. ðŸ˜º 

It's a sunny winter afternoon (-4 degrees in the morning), perfect, lets get on with this.

# Build the site
1. copy and backup the while website folder locally
1. check hugo version, run "hugo version" in terminal
1. I need to update hugo, run "brew upgrade hugo" in terminal
2. go to folder 1 level above - parent folder
3. run "hugo new site huatuostudio.github.io --force --format yaml" in terminal
1. download PaperMod theme and extract the folder from zip file
1. move the folder inside of the themems folder
1. run "git init" in terminal

One of the major decision point to use the theme is that it's multilingual support. [Look Scanned Blog](https://blog.lookscanned.io/posts/custom-language-select-in-hugo-papermod/) has a good post on how to modify the language selector.
