World famous, these colourful gardens with lily ponds and shaded walkways are instantly recognisable as the inspiration for so many of his classic artworks. Lunchtime will be spent in the medieval city of Rouen, where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431. The old town still boasts wonderful half-timbered buildings and the Notre Dame Cathedral.

Make sure you wander around the cobbled stone streets to find the perfect bistro for lunch. In the afternoon, we will visit the Palais Benedictine in F√©camp. Five hundred years ago, a Benedictine alchemist discovered a secret elixir that we now know as Benedictine liqueur.

The town still has kilometres of ancient ramparts and a massive viaduct built by Gustav Eiffel. Next we enjoy lunchtime in the classic seaside resort of Dinard, with its sea front that is lined with 19th century villas and townhouses. Time to shop and enjoy lunch in the old town centre. Later we catch the ferry across to the old port of St Malo. Arriving by boat we can get the very best view of this fully walled and fortified town. Originally an island stronghold, the town grew on the wealth bought in between the 16th and 18th centuries by the ‚Äòauthorised‚Äô pirates and freebooters. The rest of your day is at leisure to explore the cobbled streets, alleys filled with shops and caf√©s. Perhaps enjoy the 2 km walk along the ramparts that completely encircle the old town.

A walk trail links the Tree Top Walk to the Ancient Empire boardwalk where you can get up close and personal to the 400-year-old giants of the forest. This is the first time I come to the Tree Top Walk in Western Australia. The Tree Top Walk is located at the Valley of the Giants. Don‚Äôt you just love the name!

The kookaburras and some other birds were already singing and playing amongst the trees. I walked straight down to the river side. The water flows south in a steady pace and on the other side, it was a national park. Giant trees stood there along the banks. The more I looked at them, the more mysterious they seemed.

Meanwhile, everyone else from my group who flew over¬†from Australia had arrived in the international Terminal 2. There were only 2 terminals in Taipei airport but you¬†would need to catch a train to get from one to another. Grrr, I waited for 30 minutes in the wrong Terminal until one of them called me on Skype. Actually, it was not a total wast of time, I managed to charge my phone and checked my email! üòÉ We regrouped, purchased SIM cards, got connected and then, we fianlly left the airport! Yay, our Taiwan trip had officially started! üëç PC knew Taiwan the best and had plan the whole trip. This was going to be a stress free holiday for me, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling! I was so tired when we dropped off our luggages, but sleep/rest was for the weak, I cleaned up a bit and went out with the group. This was my first time in Taiwan and yet Taipei felt familiar. It felt like Beijing or Shanghai in the 90s and I loved it. I was in Shanghai in 2010, it felt crowded and dirty then. The financial district was full of overpriced imported goods, LV, Coach, Hermes, blah blah. The residential suburbs were fully of newly built high-rises. I was brought to a restaurant for a thousand Yuan Australian beef. Everything felt a bit pretentious to me. I rather eat my Australian beef in an Australian pub down the road for $25 with a beer. üòª¬†That‚Äôs just me. Local street food store Night market Night market Taibei was not as crowded, little old stores can be seen along the streets, there were street stands and many¬†markets, the food, oh, I could go on and on about the taiwanese food! We went to a day and then a night market today. Both markets sold nothing but food. I couldn‚Äôt eat street food when I was travelling in China (I always got sick) but it seemed fine in Taipei. The food were mostly traditional Southern Chinese¬†food. We would buy something from one store and¬†share it around, then move to the next store. Just to name a few of the dishes we had: clam omelet, pork rib herb soup, seafood fired noodle, sticky rice pudding (see my gallery link below for photos)‚Ä¶ Oh my god üò≥, I then managed to wash them all down with some pickled fruit and a cup of ice plum juice! The plum juice was cooked so well, it brought back some sweet¬†childhood memories! I‚Äôve never had the pickled fruit before; its called Ba Le. It tasted like a mix of apple and pear and very nutty. I bought a little bag of the fruit pickled in plum source. They were amazing! Night market Taiwaness food I insisted that we walked the 2 blocks back to Peggy‚Äôs house. I crashed in my bed with a smile - I was falling in love with Taiwan! ‚ù§Ô∏è Mountian side Taiwaness food The world famouse pineapple tart ‚Äì¬ß‚Äì ","date":"2015-04-05","objectID":"/20150405taiwan/:2:0","tags":["Foodie"],"title":"Taiwan Impression","uri":"/20150405taiwan/"},{"categories":["Tech"],"content":"I‚Äôm giving myself a üåü for finishing a little volunteer project for RSPCA (AU) ACT. :-) The idea is to create a website that contains a Pet Quiz where people answer a few questions to find out what kind of pet is the best suitable for them.

I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb. We were very lucky that we were in a 5 people group, instead of the usual 10-15 people groups. I guess that it might has something to do with the higher price for the morning climb - for the sunrise view. Everyone got to know each other pretty quickly and we were able to complete the pre-climb training ahead of schedule. The training was to give you an idea of what to or not to do on the bridge. We then had to change into the overall provided by the company. We were not allowed to take anything with us to the bridge. A bigger group would waste a lot of time on waiting for slow walker etc., because everyone has to be chained to the side of the bridge and has to walk in a line the whole time. With only 5 people, we were able to chat with each other with or without of the headphones. We could yell at each other if anyone wanted to stop for a quick photo - yes, only the guide has a camera and the camera is chained to him as well. The guide was a cute young guy. üòÇ He told us lots stories and history about the bridge. For example, did you know that a diamond ring was lost during a proposal on top of the bridge? Every since then, if one plan for a proposal on top of the bridge, one need to chain the ring on the wrist. If the girl says yes, then the ring will be transferred to her finger without leaving the chain. üòÖ FYI, the lost diamond ring was not recovered so look carefully when you walk on the bridge. haha‚Ä¶ The view on top of the bridge was amazing! I was in love with it. We could see the rain on the left hand side of the sky yet on the other side, the sun rose behind the clouds. I was very impressed! It was so beautiful! It was so worth the money! I‚Äôm going to tell everyone to do this! No wonder so many people have marriage proposals here! üòÇ It was very windy on the top of the bridge. I really understood why everything has to be chained to the hand rail. We were given ‚Äúsurvival packs‚Äù to be chained on ourselves. I was so glad to find a jumper in it because it was freezing too. There were plenty time on top of the bridge for photos, stories, history talk and time to just enjoying the view. The walk down the bridge is on the other side of the bridge. We enjoyed the different view and marveled the structure of the bridge. It was said that it takes 3 years to maintain the bridge and even more to repaint. It was said that when one round of work completes, its most likely time for the next round to start again! It makes you appreciate the design and the engineering of the bridge even more! Three of us (Steve \u0026 Sam), we have had such a good time that I was totally shocked that the whole climb took more than 2 hours! It was time for pancakes and coffee!

I‚Äôve not walked around the city of Sydney at 3am before. Relatively safe, interesting people hanging around the streets at this hour, very different from the day! This 3.5 star hotel needs thicker walls and windows! I‚Äôve asked for a higher level and a quiet floor as usual. I kept waken up by the noise from the street - they do travel up. The room next door kept you know what going for the whole night and from the noise, you could tell that there were a few people there! LOL I‚Äôve hardly slept at all between downstairs and the next door. This is why after the climb and breakfast, even with all the sugar from the pancakes, I wanted a nap! I won‚Äôt stay in this hotel again!
