A walk trail links the Tree Top Walk to the Ancient Empire boardwalk where you can get up close and personal to the 400-year-old giants of the forest. This is the first time I come to the Tree Top Walk in Western Australia. The Tree Top Walk is located at the Valley of the Giants. Don‚Äôt you just love the name! Whenever I saw the name, I always had the image of the Ent from the Lord of the Rings in my mind. The Valley of the Giants‚Äô website contain good information about the place and everything else related to it. Head over there if you would like to plan for a trip too. I enjoyed my walk at the top. Although, I don‚Äôt think one should be on this walk if one is not comfortable with heights. The walking path wave slightly when a few people walk on it with unsynchronised steps. It was pretty fun for me! It sounded like the waves in the ocean when the wind blew pass - the trees started dancing and I could hear them whispering in our ears! I wonder what stories they would tell after standing there for 100s of years. The Ancient Empire boardwalk is a 20 minute walk under the Tree Top Walk. It was certainly a different view from the bottom up! I could really appreciated the height of the Giant Tingle Trees (Eucalypts) from the ground - like the giant protectors of the forest. The air was crisp and sun shone through the branches. I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs a quite busy touristy attraction but we must have missed ALL the tourist groups! We gladly enjoyed the quietness and serenity of being one with the forest - it was such a magical feeling!

I wished that I could put them into jars for late (or sell them to China and make millions! üòÉ ). The front lawn felt like a green carpet, slightly wet. The kookaburras and some other birds were already singing and playing amongst the trees. I walked straight down to the river side. The water flows south in a steady pace and on the other side, it was a national park. Giant trees stood there along the banks. The more I looked at them, the more mysterious they seemed. I was fully expecting some kind of monster jumping out of the woods - thank goodness that there was a river protecting me. LOL! What would the monster look like? I hoped that it could not fly! üòÉ I dragged my rampaging imagination back and sat down on a small jetty, sipping hot coffee, relaxing and just enjoying this peaceful morning all by myself‚Ä¶ until the others got up. They joined me for a walk into the woods. The topic for discussion was how long would each of us live in the woods like this. I was pretty sure that I could easily stay there for a month. üòÉ After breakfast, we took off to Denmark and saw the Elephant Rock with the Green Pool. I have been there before and Denmark is truly a beautiful spot in south WA.

It felt like Beijing or Shanghai in the 90s and I loved it. I was in Shanghai in 2010, it felt crowded and dirty then. The financial district was full of overpriced imported goods, LV, Coach, Hermes, blah blah. The residential suburbs were fully of newly built high-rises.

It took me an hour to drive from King‚Äôs Cross to M3. I came from a place where there is no traffic so that little drive was killing me. At one stage, it took me 5min to drive through one traffic light. OMG! I was amazed that Londoners seemed to have a mutual understanding on when to give away to the traffic. It took me a bit to get use to seeing a double decker bus heading towards me on a one lane road with high speed. I had no idea if I should give away or not! I was pretty freaked out for the first few times then I slowly channeled in to their frequency. I would just go if the opposite side traffic stopped for one second. I really enjoyed driving in the English country side though. Not only the lush fields looked fantastic in the sun or after rain, the hedges were so high that they became green caves. I love to drive through them! travel-south-england-map Update: In a way, I could blame myself for picking up the car fro St Pancras Station. I leant from others later on that I should have booked a car outside of London. That would mean that I had to drag my luggage with me around. It was not a win win situation for sure. Update: Later, I also realised that George and Chris must have meant that it was difficult to drive when it was raining or snowing in Scotland.

I could see the French coastline across the English Channel on the beach in Folkestone. I spent a day in Canterbury. It was just nice to walk around to see the castles etc. I had the best Italian lunch at a small cafe in one of those side streets. Yum! Rye is a pretty small town in East Sussex, England. It sits on 3 rivers and the Rye Harbour is not far away. The town was full of antique shops. I had to keep telling myself that anything I bought would add weight to my luggage. I stayed in a little pub called The Ship Inn. The food there was very nice and they gave me free local beer to try. :-) I called that great customer service! Make sure to visit the little 200 years old antique house. I would not fit in through the door! LOL! Here is a little cool map of Rye. Rye was a great place for a stop over.

It was the night when England played in the 2014 World Cup. There was a big screen setup on the beach. I joined the crowd to watch the game for a while but all I could hear was the sound the pebbles made when people walked on them. It was crazily loud and I couldn‚Äôt stand the sound. I watched from a stand off the beach. England lost the game. People on the beach were either too drunk or too upset by then. The breakfast in the morning was also sht.

I soon lost interest because I was so tired that it took more effect to just keep myself awake. I walked around like a zombie for a long while! On the Sydney to Dubai flight, the girl who was sitting next to me cried her eyes out watching the Winter‚Äôs Tale so I watched RoboCop (2014) instead.

The man who sat next to me on the Heathrow to Dubai flight started to sing along while watch the Classic Hindu Songs. I wondered if he knew how loud he was or cared if others were listening.

The day was spent walking around the old town, the new town (nothing new about the new town, its built in 1700s :p), the royal mile, Edinburgh Castle etc. Edinburgh is not big, even though the tram was running, I still preferred walking. The bus ticket was cheaper than London but you need to have the right change. If you plan to go to the Edinburgh Castle, make sure that you watch the One o‚Äôclock Gun fire at 13:00 hours (every day except Sunday).

Glasgow maintained its historical buildings but I still think that Edinburgh has more character. I might sound like a broken record but Scotland is just so beautiful. Everyone was amazed and our cameras were overworked. Glen Coe has a 3 sister as well but nothing like the 3 sisters in Blue Mountains back home. Make sure that you look out for them when you are there. The mountains still had snow tops. It was drizzling but somehow, I felt that the mountains looked better in the rain. The low rainy clouds softened the mountain edges. The air was crisp clear as well. We made a few stops and everyone jumped out of the bus to enjoy the view. We were often overtaken by motorbikes on the road. I was jealous. It must be so fun to ride on these winding mountain roads! There were hikers as well. Hiking in Glen Coe looked crazy and exciting!

In Scotland, people would buy a cask of whisky for their children and keep the cask at the distillery. years later, the child would be able to celebrate his/her 50th birthday with a 50+ yrs old whisky.

This morning, after another 2 calls to the taxi company, finally, at 3.40am, I was picked up by a taxi and headed for the airport. It turned out that it was not easy to get a taxi on an early Friday morning. Sydney taxi drivers only do ‚Äúindividual jobs‚Äù which means that they would not let you share taxi with others. What do you do then? Keep calling taxi until you get one, I guess. The trip to Sydney International from the hotel was only 10 minutes yet it created so much drama. The second after I walked through the Customs line - you know, the white line taped that‚Äôs on the floor next to the Customs Officers‚Äô booths‚Ä¶ I realised that I had left my camera bag behind. Sadly, I was behind the white line so I was officially outside of Australia already! :-o I was not allowed to turn around the get my bag. I had to ask a Customs officer to get the bag for me. :-o Almost losing my Canon before the holiday even start? Clearly, getting up at 2am with only 3 hours sleep had proven to be a disaster. The TRS booth opened around 5am and there was a long queue in front of it. The airport has just opened, where did all those people come from? It looked as if they camped here overnight like an Apple new release event. It took 40min for everyone to board the A380. My feet wanted to touch the ground a bit longer so I sat and watched them. A meal and a nap later, I got up for a walk only to find out that we were just flying over Singapore. That was a bit depressing! :-o The young couple next to me watched movies on different screens. They started and paused the movies at the same time so they were on the same scene all the time. How cute! :-) The food was better on Emirates and there was more seat space. The best thing would be the power supply on each seat for the devices. My phone was on low battery already since I played with it none stop this morning - Sydney airport still offered free wifi. The headsets are horrible on Emirates‚Äôs flights, bring your own. Emirates‚Äôs OnAir Wi-Fi service lets you connect to the internet while in flight, price plans for Wi-Fi start from just USD 2.75 for smartphones and USD 7.50 for tablets and laptops (feels a bit expensive comparing with what we used on flights in US). Select A380 flights also offer mobile phone use and data roaming using GPRS/EDGE. Every seat on board the Emirates A380 has a satellite telephone and onscreen email/SMS services. I got off the flight from Sydney to Dubai, walked from arrival to departure and it was already the time to board the flight to London. I decided to be the last to board again. I just sat down and the old lady next to me leaned over and asked, ‚ÄúWhat did they say love?‚Äù ‚ÄúSection D can start boarding.‚Äù I answered. She then started telling me her life story. Her husband had passed away recently and she then was diagnosed with breast cancer. After chemotherapy, she was in remission so she decided to spend her savings to see the world. She then told me that she had missed her flight yesterday but the good people from Perth got her on another flight. ‚ÄúPerth? In Australia? I love Perth!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYes, yes, me too.‚Äù She added. We smiled at each other - now we have so much to talk about. This is the part of travelling that I enjoy the most - meeting people along the way and hear their stories.

I have to say that I have always thought the bridge climb is an overpriced tourist thing. Why would I ever do that if I live here?! :) Nevertheless, I was excited to wake up at 3am to get ready for the bridge climb. We were very lucky that we were in a 5 people group, instead of the usual 10-15 people groups. I guess that it might has something to do with the higher price for the morning climb - for the sunrise view. Everyone got to know each other pretty quickly and we were able to complete the pre-climb training ahead of schedule. The training was to give you an idea of what to or not to do on the bridge. We then had to change into the overall provided by the company. We were not allowed to take anything with us to the bridge. A bigger group would waste a lot of time on waiting for slow walker etc., because everyone has to be chained to the side of the bridge and has to walk in a line the whole time. With only 5 people, we were able to chat with each other with or without of the headphones. We could yell at each other if anyone wanted to stop for a quick photo - yes, only the guide has a camera and the camera is chained to him as well. The guide was a cute young guy. üòÇ He told us lots stories and history about the bridge. For example, did you know that a diamond ring was lost during a proposal on top of the bridge? Every since then, if one plan for a proposal on top of the bridge, one need to chain the ring on the wrist. If the girl says yes, then the ring will be transferred to her finger without leaving the chain. üòÖ FYI, the lost diamond ring was not recovered so look carefully when you walk on the bridge. haha‚Ä¶ The view on top of the bridge was amazing! I was in love with it. We could see the rain on the left hand side of the sky yet on the other side, the sun rose behind the clouds. I was very impressed! It was so beautiful! It was so worth the money! I‚Äôm going to tell everyone to do this! No wonder so many people have marriage proposals here! üòÇ the view from the top! It was very windy on the top of the bridge. I really understood why everything has to be chained to the hand rail. We were given ‚Äúsurvival packs‚Äù to be chained on ourselves. I was so glad to find a jumper in it because it was freezing too. There were plenty time on top of the bridge for photos, stories, history talk and time to just enjoying the view. The walk down the bridge is on the other side of the bridge. We enjoyed the different view and marveled the structure of the bridge. It was said that it takes 3 years to maintain the bridge and even more to repaint. It was said that when one round of work completes, its most likely time for the next round to start again! It makes you appreciate the design and the engineering of the bridge even more! Three of us (Steve \u0026 Sam), we have had such a good time that I was totally shocked that the whole climb took more than 2 hours! It was time for pancakes and coffee!
